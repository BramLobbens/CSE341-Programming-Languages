#|(1. Write a function sequence that takes 3 arguments low, high, and stride, all assumed to be numbers.
Further assume stride is positive. sequence produces a list of numbers from low to high (including
low and possibly high) separated by stride and in sorted order)|#
(define sequence
  (lambda (low high stride)
    (cond
      [(> low high) (quote ())]
      [else (cons low (sequence (+ low stride) high stride))])))

#|(2. Write a function string-append-map that takes a list of strings xs and a string suffix and returns a
list of strings. Each element of the output should be the corresponding element of the input appended
with suffix (with no extra space between the element and suffix). You must use Racket-library
functions map and string-append.)|#
(define (string-append-map l suffix)
  (map (lambda (list-item) (string-append list-item suffix)) l))

#|(3. Write a function list-nth-mod that takes a list xs and a number n. If the number is negative,
terminate the computation with (error "list-nth-mod: negative number"). Else if the list is
empty, terminate the computation with (error "list-nth-mod: empty list"). Else return the ith
element of the list where we count from zero and i is the remainder produced when dividing n by the
listâ€™s length. Library functions length, remainder, car, and list-tail are all useful)|#
(define (list-nth-mod xs n)
  (cond
    [(< n 0) (error "list-nth-mod: negative number")]
    [(null? xs) (error "list-nth-mod: empty list")]
    [else (let ([i (remainder n (length xs))])
            (car (list-tail xs i)))]))
